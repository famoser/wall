## About
Wall allows flat mates to coordinate repetitive endeavours.

It provides the following functionality:
 - shopping list (we need apples & tomatoes!)
 - question (who's up for dinner?)
 - tasks (the kitchen should be cleaned again...)
 - events (are friends coming over in the next few days?)
 - departures (when does the next bus depart?)
